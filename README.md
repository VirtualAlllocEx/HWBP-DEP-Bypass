A proof-of-concept implementation demonstrating how to execute code from non-executable memory on Windows x64 systems by combining hardware breakpoints, vectored exception handling (VEH), and instruction emulation‚Äîbypassing DEP/NX protection without modifying memory permissions.

## üìñ Overview

Data Execution Prevention (DEP) and No-Execute (NX) are memory protection mechanisms that prevent code execution from pages marked as non-executable. This proof-of-concept demonstrates a technique to bypass these protections by exploiting the timing of hardware breakpoint checks in the CPU pipeline.

### How It Works

The technique combines three Windows and CPU mechanisms to execute code from non-executable memory:
